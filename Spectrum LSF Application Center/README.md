# Spectrum LSF Application Center

This repository is where LSF Application Center sample templates can be found.  Each template requires it's own directory and will be copied to the /opt/ibm/lsfsuite/ext/gui/conf/application/draft directory.  Once they are copied there, they can be published.

All Spectrum LSF Application Center Templates published here are covered under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

If you plan or would like to contribute sample templates, you must follow the DCO process in the attached [DCO Readme file](https://github.com/lsf-integrations/Spectrum LSF Application Center/master/IBMDCO.md) in the root of this repository.  It essentially requires you to provide a Sign Off line in the notes of your pull request stating that the work is clear of infinging work by others.  Again, for more details, please see the DCO Readme file.

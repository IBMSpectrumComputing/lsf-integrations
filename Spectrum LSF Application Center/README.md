# Spectrum LSF Application Center

This repository is where LSF Application Center sample templates can be found.  Each template requires it's own directory and will be copied to the /opt/ibm/lsfsuite/ext/gui/conf/application/draft directory.  Once they are copied there, they can be published.

All Spectrum LSF Application Center Templates published here are covered under the Eclipse Public License.
